## Description
After you have drafted your solution and prioritized the work ahead of you, you need to build credibility in the eyes of your clients. How can they trust you and be sure that you understand what should be done? Why should they believe that you are the person who needs to create all requirements?
During this phase, you will draw the prototype that will reflect your user journey and allow you to check if you have chosen the right approach or not. To do that, you will have to complete 3 mandatory tasks:
#### "Requirements documentation"
#### "Prototype with Wireframes"
#### "Requirements management"
