Conduct interviews with stakeholders to gather information about their needs, expectations, and concerns. Record the interview using notes, audio, or video recording tools. Create an MFU. Analyze the data collected from the interview to identify key themes and insights. Use the insights from the interview to refine the project requirements and solution concept.
### 2.	List of FR/NFR
Create a list of functional and non-functional requirements. Establish a traceability matrix to track each requirement throughout the project.
