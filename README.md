## Project description
Imagine your company received a customer request from a US company looking for a solution for a Digital Wardrobe app.
An app that will take the user's wardrobe to the next level: they can now enter any item of clothing they have into the app and categorize it by season, brand, color, style, etc. They don't have to spend hours every morning deciding what put on in front of mirrow, they can browse their clothes online and create stylish outfits anytime, anywhere. They can also use virtual stylist suggestions and make wise shopping decisions based on what they already have and what they really need.
